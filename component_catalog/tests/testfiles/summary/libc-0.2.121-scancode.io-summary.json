This\nincludes type definitions (e.g. `c_int`), constants (e.g. `EINVAL`) as well as\nfunction headers (e.g. `malloc`).\n\nThis crate exports all underlying platform types, functions, and constants under\nthe crate root, so all items are accessible as `libc::foo`. The types and values\nof all the exported APIs match the platform that libc is compiled for.\n\nMore detailed information about the design of this library can be found in its\n[associated RFC][rfc].\n\n[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1291-promote-libc.md\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibc = \"0.2\"\n```\n\n## Features\n\n* `std`: by default `libc` links to the standard library. Disable this\n  feature to remove this dependency and be able to use `libc` in `#![no_std]`\n  crates.\n\n* `extra_traits`: all `struct`s implemented in `libc` are `Copy` and `Clone`.\n  This feature derives `Debug`, `Eq`, `Hash`, and `PartialEq`.\n\n* `const-extern-fn`: Changes some `extern fn`s into `const extern fn`s.\n   This feature requires a nightly rustc.\n\n* **deprecated**: `use_std` is deprecated, and is equivalent to `std`.\n\n## Rust version support\n\nThe minimum supported Rust toolchain version is **Rust 1.13.0** . APIs requiring\nnewer Rust features are only available on newer Rust toolchains:\n\n| Feature              | Version |\n|----------------------|---------|\n| `union`              |  1.19.0 |\n| `const mem::size_of` |  1.24.0 |\n| `repr(align)`        |  1.25.0 |\n| `extra_traits`       |  1.25.0 |\n| `core::ffi::c_void`  |  1.30.0 |\n| `repr(packed(N))`    |  1.33.0 |\n| `cfg(target_vendor)` |  1.33.0 |\n\n## Platform support\n\n[Platform-specific documentation (master branch)][docs.master].\n\nSee\n[`ci/build.sh`](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/master/ci/build.sh)\nfor the platforms on which `libc` is guaranteed to build for each Rust\ntoolchain. The test-matrix at [GitHub Actions] and [Cirrus CI] show the\nplatforms in which `libc` tests are run.\n\n<div class=\"platform_docs\"></div>\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under either of\n\n* [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n  ([LICENSE-APACHE](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE))\n\n* [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n  ([LICENSE-MIT](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT))\n\nat your option.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome all people who want to contribute.
