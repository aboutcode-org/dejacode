How can I download SBOM for my products?
----------------------------------------

**CycloneDX SBOM and SPDX document** can be downloaded from the "Share" menu of
the product details view in the web UI or from dedicated endpoint URLs of the REST API.

Refer to :ref:`how_to_3` for more details.

How can I integrate DejaCode with my tools or applications?
-----------------------------------------------------------

DejaCode supports three main integration approaches:

- **Platform-specific integrations** for GitHub, GitLab, Jira, SourceHut, and Forgejo
  (:ref:`platform_specific_integrations`)
- The **REST API** for programmatic access to data and operations
  (:ref:`rest_api_integration`)
- **Webhooks** for receiving real-time event notifications
  (:ref:`webhook_integration`)

The last two options — REST API and webhooks — enable **generic integration** with
virtually any application or service, giving you full flexibility to connect
DejaCode to your existing tools and workflows.
