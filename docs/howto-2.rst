How To 2 - Take Advantage of Reference Data
===========================================

Sign into DejaCode.

.. note:: Sign in as a User with full administrative permissions.

Explore and Copy Reference Data
===============================

In this example, you are researching ways to get the most out of your DejaCode data
by creating Queries and Reports. One way to get started on this is to explore the
Queries that are already defined in Reference Data. This is a good way to get better
acquainted with methods for taking advantage of the various Query features.

- Select the :guilabel:`Dashboard` option from the dropdown beneath your User name.
- Select the :guilabel:`Queries` option in the :guilabel:`Reporting` panel.
- Review the Queries currently defined for your dataspace.
- Optionally click the :guilabel:`View Reference Data` button in the upper left section
  of the form. Review the Reference Data Queries. Optionally, you can
  click the :guilabel:`Copy to my Dataspace` button to the left of any entry in order to
  add or update a Query to your own Dataspace from Reference Data.
- Alternatively you can click to select multiple Queries on the Browse form, and then
  you can use the :guilabel:`Copy selected objects` choice in the dropdown in the
  lower left part of the form. Follow the prompts to copy or update the Reference
  Queries to your own Dataspace.

  You can follow a similar procedure to copy Column Templates and Reports from
  Reference Data to your own Dataspace.

Check for Updates to a Specific Object in Reference Data
========================================================

In the DejaCode user view of your own Dataspace, when you are viewing the details of
an Owner, a License, a Package, or a Component, you can click on a button in the upper
part of the form called :guilabel:`Check for Updates` which will prompt DejaCode
to present you with a form either telling you that the two objects are exactly the same
or that you can select specific fields to apply updated values from Reference Data
to your own Dataspace. Simply follow the prompts to make those changes.

Check for Recently Updated Objects in Reference Data
====================================================

As and administrative user, you can use the dropdown list in the upper-right corner
of DejaCode to select Components, Packages, Licenses or Owners to navigate to the
Administrator's Browse forms for those objects. From the Browse form, you can click
the :guilabel:`View Reference Data` button in the upper left section of the form to
prompt DejaCode to show you the current contents of Reference Data. Note that the
objects are by default sorted by Date Modified descending, so you can easily see the
most recent updates. You can also search and filter the results to find groups of
objects that interest you, and you can follow a procedure similar to the one described
above for Queries to copy or update Reference Data objects to your own Dataspace.

Preserving Specific Field Values in Your Dataspace
==================================================

When you copy Reference Data that already exists in your own Dataspace, you should
note that DejaCode allows you to exclude certain fields when you take that action.
An important example where this is important to you is the **Usage Policy** field,
since that is a value you set to comply with your own business requirements. By default,
DejaCode excludes **Usage Policy** when updating an object to your Dataspace from
Reference Data, and you may also select other fields to preserve as well.
