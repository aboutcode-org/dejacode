  Parse and use crontab schedules in Python
  Copyright 2011-2021 Josiah Carlson

  Released under the LGPL license version 2.1 and version 3 (you can choose
  which you'd like to be bound under).

  Description
  ===========

  This package intends to offer a method of parsing crontab schedule entries and
  determining when an item should next be run. More specifically, it calculates
  a delay in seconds from when the .next() method is called to when the item
  should next be executed.

  Comparing the below chart to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression
  you will note that W and # symbols are not supported.

  ============= =========== ================= ============== ===========================
  Field Name    Mandatory   Allowed Values    Default Value  Allowed Special Characters
  ============= =========== ================= ============== ===========================
  Seconds       No          0-59              0              \* / , -
  Minutes       Yes         0-59              N/A            \* / , -
  Hours         Yes         0-23              N/A            \* / , -
  Day of month  Yes         1-31              N/A            \* / , - ? L
  Month         Yes         1-12 or JAN-DEC   N/A            \* / , -
  Day of week   Yes         0-6 or SUN-SAT    N/A            \* / , - ? L
  Year          No          1970-2099         *              \* / , -
  ============= =========== ================= ============== ===========================

  If your cron entry has 5 values, minutes-day of week are used, default seconds
  is and default year is appended. If your cron entry has 6 values, minutes-year
  are used, and default seconds are prepended.

  As such, only 5-7 value crontab entries are accepted (and mangled to 7 values,
  as necessary).


  Sample individual crontab fields
  ================================

  Examples of supported entries are as follows::

      *
      */5
      7/8
      3-25/7
      3,7,9
      0-10,30-40/5

  For month or day of week entries, 3 letter abbreviations of the month or day
  can be used to the left of any optional / where a number could be used.

  For days of the week::

      mon-fri
      sun-thu/2

  For month::

      apr-jul
      mar-sep/3

  Installation
  ============

  ::

      pip install crontab


  Example uses
  ============

  ::

      >>> from crontab import CronTab
      >>> from datetime import datetime
      >>> # define the crontab for 25 minutes past the hour every hour
      ... entry = CronTab('25 * * * *')
      >>> # find the delay from when this was run (around 11:13AM)
      ... entry.next()
      720.81637899999998
      >>> # find the delay from when it was last scheduled
      ... entry.next(datetime(2011, 7, 17, 11, 25))
      3600.0




  Notes
  =====

  At most one of 'day of week' or 'day of month' can be a value other than '?'
  or '*'. We violate spec here and allow '*' to be an alias for '?', in the case
  where one of those values is specified (seeing as some platforms don't support
  '?').

  This module also supports the convenient aliases::

      @yearly
      @annually
      @monthly
      @weekly
      @daily
      @hourly

  Example full crontab entries and their meanings::

      30 */2 * * * -> 30 minutes past the hour every 2 hours
      15,45 23 * * * -> 11:15PM and 11:45PM every day
      0 1 ? * SUN -> 1AM every Sunday
      0 1 * * SUN -> 1AM every Sunday (same as above)
      0 0 1 jan/2 * 2011-2013 ->
          midnight on January 1, 2011 and the first of every odd month until
          the end of 2013
      24 7 L * * -> 7:24 AM on the last day of every month
      24 7 * * L5 -> 7:24 AM on the last friday of every month
      24 7 * * Lwed-fri ->
          7:24 AM on the last wednesday, thursday, and friday of every month
