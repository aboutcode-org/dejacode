  ----

  This CycloneDX module for Python can generate valid CycloneDX bill-of-material document containing an aggregate of all
  project dependencies.

  This module is not designed for standalone use.

  If you're looking for a CycloneDX tool to run to generate (SBOM) software bill-of-materials documents, why not checkout: [CycloneDX Python][cyclonedx-python]

  Additionally, the following tool can be used as well (and this library was written to help improve it) [Jake][jake].

  Additionally, you can use this module yourself in your application to programmatically generate SBOMs.

  CycloneDX is a lightweight BOM specification that is easily created, human-readable, and simple to parse.

  View our documentation [here](https://cyclonedx-python-library.readthedocs.io/).

  ## Python Support

  We endeavour to support all functionality for all [current actively supported Python versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  However, some features may not be possible/present in older Python versions due to their lack of support.

  ## Changelog

  See our [CHANGELOG][chaneglog_file].
