DejaCode
========

DejaCode is a complete enterprise-level application to automate open source license
compliance and ensure software supply chain integrity, powered by
`ScanCode <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_,
the industry-leading code scanner.

- Run scans and track all the open source and third-party products and components used
  in your software.
- Apply usage policies at the license or component level, and integrate into
  ScanCode to ensure compliance.
- Capture software inventories (SBOMs), generate compliance artifacts, and keep
  historical data.
- Ensure FOSS compliance with enterprise-grade features and integrations for DevOps and
  software systems.
- Scan a software package, simply by providing its Download URL, to get comprehensive
  details of its composition and create an SBOM.
- Load software package data into DejaCode with the integration for the open source
  ScanCode.io and ScanCode Toolkit projects to create a productâ€™s SBOM.
- Track and report vulnerability tracking and reporting by integrating with the open
  source VulnerableCode project.
- Create, publish and share SBOM documents in DejaCode, including detailed attribution
  documentation and custom reports in multiple file formats and standards, such as
  CycloneDX and SPDX.
